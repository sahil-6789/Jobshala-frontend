#### For Job Seeker

1. Register
2. Update Profile
3. Apply on jobs - just by clicking - as simple as that.

#### For Job Poster

1. Post Jobs
2. Get applications on your posted jobs and shortlist.
3. **Ease the flow** for both parties
   - Job Seekers Profiles will be available all throughout, Recruiters can directly see their profiles and give them a message/call

#### Problems in Existing Solutions

- Little Less user friendly for maybe not so literate people
- Complicated Process - Blue Collars dont have a resume.
- All in English
- Lack of Support on chat/call

### Pending Tasks

- Login Sessions and Dashboard of Applications
- No Authentication for recruiter
- Facility to remove the job once you gets hired

### Additional Features to add:

- Multi-lingual -> Done
- Filters according to location, salary etc.
- Stars/Reviews for job seekers
